            <h2>Most streamed Rock songs on Spotify</h2>
            <p>
              Since its launch as a humble Swedish start-up in 2008, Spotify has
              grown to become the biggest streaming platform in the world. And
              love it or hate it, Spotify is an important metric of success in
              the modern music industry. Drake became the first artist to
              achieve a billion streams for a single song, with One Dance in
              2016. Since then, a total of 446 songs have passed that same
              milestone, with two - The Weeknd's Blinding Lights and Ed
              Sheeran's Shape Of You surpassing an incredible 3 billion plays
              each. When it comes to rock music, and especially legacy rock
              music, there are questions of demographic and preference at play.
              Nearly two thirds of Spotify's users are aged under 35 and rock
              fans are more likely than others to listen to traditional radio
              and music on physical formats. The average age of the Spotify user
              is creeping up though and streaming is now by far the most common
              method of music consumption across all combined age groups. Queen
              are the best-performing rock band to have joined Spotify's
              Billions Club. The 2011 remaster of Bohemian Rhapsody is currently
              sitting pretty at nearly 2.2 billion streams and they also have
              another four tracks in the list. Elsewhere, AC/DC have three
              billion-streamers in Back In Black, Highway To Hell and
              Thunderstruck. Notable by their absence are monsters of rock like
              the Rolling Stones, whose best-performing track Paint It Black is
              just shy of 938 million streams, the Foo Fighters (with Everlong
              on more than 886m) and Led Zeppelin (846m for Stairway To Heaven).

                <h2>Coachella 2024</h2>
                <p>
                  This year's Coachella event began attracting negative
                  publicity even before the doors opened last Friday. In
                  January, SFGate reported that Coachella 2024 was beset by the
                  festival's slowest ticket sales in a decade. Things picked up,
                  but according to Billboard, only 80% of the 250,000 tickets
                  available sold out before the festival began, which is "14%
                  -17% down" on last year.

                <h2>Guitars at auction</h2>
                <p>
                  If there's one Kurt Cobain guitar moment that's become even
                  more iconic than the Teen Spirit video, it's Nirvana's
                  incredible bittersweet performance on MTV Unplugged. Kurt
                  bought the D-18E in 1992at Voltage Guitars in Los Angeles, and
                  it's a rare bird for Martin guitars in that it came out of the
                  factory with the DeArmond pickups. Guitar sold out for
                  $6,010,000.

                <h2>The Dark Side of the Moon</h2>
                <p>
                  The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the
                  English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by
                  Harvest Records in the UK and Capitol Records in the US. After
                  Half a Century, 'The Dark Side of the Moon' Still
                  Reverberates. Pink Floyd's enduring blockbuster merged
                  grandeur and malaise. Very much a product of its era, it
                  became one of the best-selling albums of all time.
